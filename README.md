Design
  1. The most helpful design method for my project was looking at the use case and modeling out how the  porgram is going to interact with diffrent systems and use cases.
  2. The most difficalt thing for me was managing my time between this project and my SSW322 project. I would try and start this earilier and making more time to work on this.
  3. I think that I would like to try and use the class design model more as i think it would give a more unique perspective.
Implementation
  1. In the implementation of the bot and testing was looking at how the api works and what use cases this bot could be used for.
  2. The most difficult part of the implementation was doing it and getting the information to implement it as i have never worked on a bot before even though I have used java script before it is diffrent how you code it.
  3. In the implementation and testing I would like to try and use more automated testing as this would allow for more consitant testing along with less time of testing it.
Process
  1. The Kanban board was very helpful in keeping track of where everything is in the development of the app since this was all done primarily on diffrent branches.
  2. The most difficult part was keeping it up to date allowing use to keep track of what we are doing.
  3. I would want to try and use the kanban board more and also issues in a more better way to keep track of the project.
Overall
  In my software development projects I have not fully used these practices even not knowing there name. I belive these practices are helpful and will help in the future along with helping me with in this project and also my SSW 322.
